       " 'r1_solution_1': 'Okay, so I need to find the auxiliary equation for the given ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients: \\\\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\\\sin(2\\\\log x)\\\\sin(\\\\log x)\\\\). Hmm, let me start by recalling what an auxiliary equation is. From my classes, I remember that for linear ODEs with constant coefficients, we often use characteristic equations, which are also called auxiliary equations. These are polynomial equations obtained by replacing the differential operator \\\\(D\\\\) with a variable, usually \\\\(m\\\\), and solving for \\\\(m\\\\). The roots of this equation help determine the general solution to the homogeneous equation.\\n\\nBut wait, the given differential equation here is \\\\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\\\sin(2\\\\log x)\\\\sin(\\\\log x)\\\\). The operator here is \\\\(x^2D^2 + xD + 1\\\\), which involves variable coefficients since \\\\(x\\\\) is multiplied with the differential operators. However, the problem states that it\\'s an ODE with constant coefficients. That seems contradictory. Maybe there\\'s a substitution that can convert this into an equation with constant coefficients?\\n\\nI think when the differential equation has terms like \\\\(x^2D^2\\\\), \\\\(xD\\\\), etc., it might be a Cauchy-Euler equation. Cauchy-Euler equations are linear ODEs with variable coefficients, but they can be transformed into constant coefficient equations by using a substitution. The standard form of a Cauchy-Euler equation is \\\\(ax^2y\\'\\' + bxy\\' + cy = f(x)\\\\), which looks similar to our given equation. So, if this is a Cauchy-Euler equation, then we can make the substitution \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\) to convert it into a constant coefficient ODE.\\n\\nLet me try that. Let \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\). Then, \\\\(x = e^t\\\\), and we can express the derivatives with respect to \\\\(x\\\\) in terms of derivatives with respect to \\\\(t\\\\). \\n\\nFirst, compute \\\\(dy/dx\\\\). Using the chain rule: \\\\(\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{dy}{dt} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{dt}{dx} = \\\\frac{dy}{dt} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\). So, \\\\(x\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{dy}{dt}\\\\).\\n\\nNext, compute the second derivative. Let\\'s denote \\\\(D = \\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\), so \\\\(D = \\\\frac{d}{dx} = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{dt}{dx} = \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\). Therefore, \\\\(D^2 = \\\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} = \\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\right)\\\\). Let\\'s compute that:\\n\\nFirst derivative operator: \\\\(D = \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\).\\n\\nSecond derivative: \\\\(D^2 = \\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\right) = -\\\\frac{1}{x^2}\\\\frac{d}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\).\\n\\nNow, \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\frac{d}{dt} = \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\) since mixed partial derivatives commute (assuming the function is nice). Wait, actually, no. Let\\'s see. \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt} = x\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\), so \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\frac{d}{dt} = \\\\frac{d}{dx}(x\\\\frac{d}{dx}) = \\\\frac{d}{dx} + x\\\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\\\\). Hmm, maybe there\\'s a better way to compute \\\\(D^2\\\\).\\n\\nAlternatively, using the chain rule again. Let\\'s denote \\\\(D_t = \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\). Then, since \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\), \\\\(dt/dx = 1/x\\\\), so \\\\(D = \\\\frac{d}{dx} = \\\\frac{1}{x} D_t\\\\). Therefore, \\\\(x D = D_t\\\\), and \\\\(x^2 D^2 = x D (x D) - x D\\\\). Wait, this might be a better approach.\\n\\nLet me recall that for the Cauchy-Euler equation, when we make the substitution \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\), the operator \\\\(x D\\\\) becomes \\\\(D_t\\\\), and \\\\(x^2 D^2\\\\) becomes \\\\(D_t(D_t - 1)\\\\). Let me verify this.\\n\\nStarting with \\\\(x D = D_t\\\\), as we saw earlier. Then, \\\\(x^2 D^2 = x D (x D) - x D\\\\). Applying \\\\(x D\\\\) to \\\\(x D\\\\), we have \\\\(x D (x D y) = x D (x y\\') = x (y\\' + x y\\'\\')\\\\). Which is \\\\(x y\\' + x^2 y\\'\\'\\\\). Therefore, \\\\(x^2 D^2 = x D (x D) - x D = (x D)^2 - x D\\\\). Since \\\\(x D = D_t\\\\), this becomes \\\\(D_t^2 - D_t\\\\). Therefore, \\\\(x^2 D^2 = D_t(D_t - 1)\\\\).\\n\\nSo, substituting into the original operator \\\\(x^2 D^2 + x D + 1\\\\), we get:\\n\\n\\\\(D_t(D_t - 1) + D_t + 1 = D_t^2 - D_t + D_t + 1 = D_t^2 + 1\\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the original differential equation \\\\(x^2 D^2 y + x D y + y = \\\\sin(2 \\\\log x) \\\\sin(\\\\log x)\\\\) transforms into \\\\(D_t^2 y + y = \\\\sin(2 t) \\\\sin(t)\\\\), where \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\).\\n\\nSo, now we have a constant coefficient ODE in terms of \\\\(t\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\(y\\'\\'(t) + y(t) = \\\\sin(2t) \\\\sin(t)\\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the auxiliary equation is obtained by considering the homogeneous equation \\\\(y\\'\\' + y = 0\\\\). The characteristic (auxiliary) equation is \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\). Solving this gives \\\\(m = \\\\pm i\\\\), which are complex roots. But since the problem only asks for the auxiliary equation, not its roots or the solution, the answer is \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\).\\n\\nWait, but let me make sure I didn\\'t skip any steps. The original equation was converted to a constant coefficient equation via substitution, and then the auxiliary equation is for the transformed equation. The problem statement mentions \"the ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients\", which probably refers to the transformed equation after the substitution. Therefore, the auxiliary equation is indeed \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\).\\n\\nBut just to be thorough, let\\'s check again. The original equation is a Cauchy-Euler equation, which typically requires the substitution \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\) to turn it into a constant coefficient linear ODE. Once we do that substitution, the equation becomes \\\\(y\\'\\'(t) + y(t) = \\\\sin(2t)\\\\sin(t)\\\\), as I found. Then, the homogeneous part is \\\\(y\\'\\' + y = 0\\\\), whose auxiliary equation is \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\). That seems correct.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the question had asked for the auxiliary equation associated directly with the original equation (even though it\\'s variable coefficient), but the problem says \"with constant coefficients\", which suggests that perhaps we need to consider the equation after substitution. Because the original equation isn\\'t constant coefficient, but after substitution, it is. So, the auxiliary equation is for the transformed constant coefficient equation.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\). So, boxed, it\\'s \\\\boxed{m^2 + 1 = 0}.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{m^2 + 1 = 0}\\n</think>\\n\\nTo find the auxiliary equation for the given ordinary differential equation \\\\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\\\sin(2\\\\log x)\\\\sin(\\\\log x)\\\\), we recognize it as a Cauchy-Euler equation. We use the substitution \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\) to convert it into a constant coefficient ODE.\\n\\n1. **Substitution**: Let \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\). Then, \\\\(x = e^t\\\\) and the differential operators transform as follows:\\n   - \\\\(x \\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{dy}{dt}\\\\)\\n   - \\\\(x^2 \\\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - \\\\frac{dy}{dt}\\\\)\\n\\n2. **Transforming the Equation**: Substituting these into the original equation, we get:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 D^2 y + x D y + y = \\\\sin(2 \\\\log x) \\\\sin(\\\\log x)\\n   \\\\]\\n   transforms into:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\left(\\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - \\\\frac{dy}{dt}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + y = \\\\sin(2t) \\\\sin(t)\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying, we obtain:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + y = \\\\sin(2t) \\\\sin(t)\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. **Auxiliary Equation**: The homogeneous part of the transformed equation is \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + y = 0\\\\). The auxiliary equation for this is:\\n   \\\\[\\n   m^2 + 1 = 0\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the auxiliary equation for the given differential equation is \\\\(\\\\boxed{m^2 + 1 = 0}\\\\).',\n",
       " 'r1_solution_2': \"Okay, so I need to find the auxiliary equation for this ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients: \\\\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\\\sin(2\\\\log x)\\\\sin(\\\\log x)\\\\). Hmm, let me start by recalling what an auxiliary equation is. From what I remember, the auxiliary equation (also called the characteristic equation) is a polynomial equation obtained by replacing the differential operator \\\\(D\\\\) with a variable \\\\(m\\\\), right? This is used to find the solution to the homogeneous equation. But wait, the given ODE here is nonhomogeneous because of the right-hand side. But the question specifically asks for the auxiliary equation, so maybe I just need to focus on the left-hand side?\\n\\nFirst, let me parse the differential equation. It's written as \\\\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\\\sin(2\\\\log x)\\\\sin(\\\\log x)\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is the differential operator \\\\(d/dx\\\\). However, the problem mentions that the ODE has constant coefficients, but I see \\\\(x^2\\\\) and \\\\(x\\\\) multiplied by the derivatives. That seems variable coefficient, not constant. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe there's a substitution involved here? Because if the coefficients are constants, but the equation has \\\\(x^2\\\\) and \\\\(x\\\\), perhaps they are using a different independent variable?\\n\\nAh, yes, Euler-Cauchy equations! I remember those. They are equations of the form \\\\(x^2y'' + axy' + by = 0\\\\), which have variable coefficients but can be transformed into constant coefficient equations by substituting \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\). Let me confirm that.\\n\\nSo, if we let \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\), then \\\\(x = e^t\\\\), and the derivatives transform as follows:\\n\\nFirst derivative: \\\\(dy/dx = (dy/dt)(dt/dx) = (1/x) dy/dt\\\\).\\n\\nSecond derivative: \\\\(d^2y/dx^2 = d/dx ( (1/x) dy/dt ) = - (1/x^2) dy/dt + (1/x) d/dx (dy/dt)\\\\).\\n\\nBut \\\\(d/dx (dy/dt) = (d^2y/dt^2)(dt/dx) = (1/x) d^2y/dt^2\\\\).\\n\\nSo, putting it together, the second derivative is:\\n\\n\\\\(d^2y/dx^2 = - (1/x^2) dy/dt + (1/x^2) d^2y/dt^2 = (1/x^2)(d^2y/dt^2 - dy/dt)\\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, substituting into the original equation:\\n\\n\\\\(x^2D^2y + xDy + y = x^2*( (1/x^2)(y'' - y') ) + x*( (1/x)y' ) + y = (y'' - y') + y' + y = y'' + y\\\\).\\n\\nSo, the transformed equation is \\\\(y'' + y = \\\\sin(2t)\\\\sin(t)\\\\), since \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the left-hand side becomes a constant coefficient equation \\\\(y'' + y = \\\\text{right-hand side}\\\\). So, the auxiliary equation would be obtained from the homogeneous equation \\\\(y'' + y = 0\\\\), which is \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\). Therefore, the auxiliary equation is \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\), right?\\n\\nWait, let me check again. The original equation is \\\\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\\\sin(2\\\\log x)\\\\sin(\\\\log x)\\\\). After substitution \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\), the operator \\\\(x^2D^2 + xD + 1\\\\) becomes \\\\(D_t^2 + 1\\\\), where \\\\(D_t\\\\) is the derivative with respect to \\\\(t\\\\). So, yes, the transformed equation is \\\\(y'' + y = \\\\sin(2t)\\\\sin(t)\\\\), and the auxiliary equation is \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\), which can be written as \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\).\\n\\nBut let me verify once more to ensure I didn't skip any steps. So, the original differential operator is \\\\(x^2D_x^2 + xD_x + 1\\\\). To convert this into a constant coefficient operator, we use the substitution \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\), which implies that \\\\(D_x = (1/x)D_t\\\\), as I did before. Then:\\n\\n\\\\(x^2D_x^2 = x^2*(D_x)^2 = x^2*( (1/x)D_t )^2 = x^2*(1/x^2)D_t^2 - x^2*(1/x^2)D_t = D_t^2 - D_t\\\\).\\n\\nWait, let me compute this carefully. The first derivative operator \\\\(D_x\\\\) is \\\\( (1/x) D_t \\\\). Then, the second derivative \\\\(D_x^2\\\\) is \\\\( D_x (D_x) = D_x ( (1/x) D_t ) \\\\). Applying the product rule:\\n\\n\\\\( D_x ( (1/x) D_t ) = (D_x(1/x)) D_t + (1/x) D_x D_t \\\\).\\n\\nCompute \\\\( D_x (1/x) = -1/x^2 \\\\). Then, \\\\( D_x D_t = D_t D_x \\\\), but since \\\\( D_t \\\\) is \\\\( x D_x \\\\), maybe there's a commutation relation here. Wait, maybe it's simpler to express everything in terms of \\\\( t \\\\).\\n\\nAlternatively, using the chain rule again. Let's see, if \\\\( t = \\\\log x \\\\), then \\\\( dt/dx = 1/x \\\\), so \\\\( d/dx = (1/x) d/dt \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( D_x = (1/x) D_t \\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, \\\\( x D_x = x*(1/x) D_t = D_t \\\\).\\n\\nSimilarly, \\\\( x^2 D_x^2 = x^2 * D_x (D_x) = x^2 * D_x ( (1/x) D_t ) \\\\).\\n\\nCompute \\\\( D_x ( (1/x) D_t ) = (D_x (1/x)) D_t + (1/x) D_x D_t \\\\).\\n\\nFirst term: \\\\( D_x (1/x) = -1/x^2 \\\\), so that term is \\\\( -1/x^2 D_t \\\\).\\n\\nSecond term: \\\\( (1/x) D_x D_t \\\\). Now, \\\\( D_x D_t \\\\) is the same as \\\\( D_t D_x \\\\), but since \\\\( D_t = x D_x \\\\), perhaps we can write:\\n\\nWait, \\\\( D_t = x D_x \\\\), so \\\\( D_x = (1/x) D_t \\\\). Then \\\\( D_x D_t = (1/x) D_t D_t = (1/x) D_t^2 \\\\).\\n\\nWait, actually, operators don't commute in general. Let's compute \\\\( D_x D_t \\\\).\\n\\nGiven that \\\\( D_t = x D_x \\\\), so \\\\( D_x D_t = D_x (x D_x) = (D_x x) D_x + x D_x^2 = (1) D_x + x D_x^2 \\\\).\\n\\nBut \\\\( D_x = (1/x) D_t \\\\), so substitute:\\n\\n\\\\( D_x D_t = (1/x) D_t + x D_x^2 \\\\).\\n\\nHmm, this seems getting complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is better.\\n\\nWait, we have:\\n\\n\\\\( x^2 D_x^2 + x D_x + 1 \\\\).\\n\\nExpressed in terms of \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( t = \\\\log x \\\\), then \\\\( D_x = (1/x) D_t \\\\), so \\\\( x D_x = D_t \\\\), and \\\\( x^2 D_x^2 = x^2 (D_x)^2 = x^2 ( (1/x) D_t )^2 - x^2 (1/x^2) D_t \\\\). Wait, no, maybe not.\\n\\nAlternatively, using the formula for transforming derivatives:\\n\\nIf \\\\( t = \\\\log x \\\\), then \\\\( y'(x) = dy/dx = (dy/dt)(dt/dx) = (1/x) dy/dt \\\\).\\n\\nSimilarly, \\\\( y''(x) = d/dx ( (1/x) dy/dt ) = - (1/x^2) dy/dt + (1/x) d/dx ( dy/dt ) \\\\).\\n\\nBut \\\\( d/dx ( dy/dt ) = (d^2 y)/(dt^2) (dt/dx) = (1/x) (d^2 y)/(dt^2) \\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, \\\\( y''(x) = - (1/x^2) dy/dt + (1/x^2) d^2 y/dt^2 \\\\).\\n\\nMultiply by \\\\( x^2 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\( x^2 y''(x) = - dy/dt + d^2 y/dt^2 \\\\).\\n\\nSo the operator \\\\( x^2 D_x^2 \\\\) becomes \\\\( D_t^2 - D_t \\\\).\\n\\nSimilarly, \\\\( x D_x \\\\) is \\\\( D_t \\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, putting it all together:\\n\\n\\\\( x^2 D_x^2 + x D_x + 1 = (D_t^2 - D_t) + D_t + 1 = D_t^2 + 1 \\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the transformed operator is \\\\( D_t^2 + 1 \\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the original ODE becomes \\\\( (D_t^2 + 1) y = \\\\sin(2t) \\\\sin(t) \\\\).\\n\\nSo, the homogeneous equation is \\\\( y'' + y = 0 \\\\), which has the auxiliary equation \\\\( m^2 + 1 = 0 \\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the auxiliary equation is \\\\( m^2 + 1 = 0 \\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the answer should be \\\\( m^2 + 1 = 0 \\\\), boxed as \\\\boxed{m^2 + 1 = 0}.\\n\\nBut just to make sure, let me check if there's any chance that the substitution affects the auxiliary equation. Since the substitution converts the variable coefficient equation into a constant coefficient one, the auxiliary equation is derived from the transformed equation, which is indeed \\\\( y'' + y = 0 \\\\). So, yes, the auxiliary equation is \\\\( m^2 + 1 = 0 \\\\).\\n\\nI don't see any mistakes in the substitution steps. The key was recognizing that the original equation is an Euler-Cauchy equation, which requires a substitution \\\\( t = \\\\log x \\\\) to transform it into a constant coefficient linear ODE. Once transformed, the auxiliary equation is straightforward.\\n\\nSo, yeah, the auxiliary equation is definitely \\\\( m^2 + 1 = 0 \\\\).\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe auxiliary equation is \\\\boxed{m^2 + 1 = 0}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo find the auxiliary equation for the ordinary differential equation \\\\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\\\sin(2\\\\log x)\\\\sin(\\\\log x)\\\\) with constant coefficients, we recognize that this is an Euler-Cauchy equation.

First, I remember that when dealing with linear ODEs with variable coefficients, especially ones that have terms like \\\\(x^2D^2\\\\) and \\\\(xD\\\\), a common technique is to use a substitution to transform the equation into one with constant coefficients.

Applying the derivative:\\n\\n\\\\(d/dx [(1/x) dy/dt] = - (1/x^2) dy/dt + (1/x) d/dx (dy/dt)\\\\).\\n\\nNow, \\\\(d/dx (dy/dt)\\\\) is \\\\(d^2 y/dt^2 * dt/dx = (d^2 y/dt^2)(1/x)\\\\).\\n\\nSo putting it all together:\\n\\n\\\\(D^2 y = - (1/x^2) dy/dt + (1/x^2) d^2 y/dt^2\\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, \\\\(x^2 D^2 y = - dy/dt + d^2 y/dt^2 = D_t^2 y - D_t y\\\\).\\n\\nSo, substituting back into the original ODE:\\n\\n\\\\(x^2 D^2 y + x D y + y = (D_t^2 - D_t) y + D_t y + y = D_t^2 y - D_t y + D_t y + y = D_t^2 y + y\\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the left-hand side of the equation simplifies to \\\\(D_t^2 y + y\\\\). So, the ODE becomes:\\n\\n\\\\(D_t^2 y + y = \\\\sin(2\\\\log x)\\\\sin(\\\\log x)\\\\).\\n\\nBut since \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\), the right-hand side becomes \\\\(\\\\sin(2t)\\\\sin(t)\\\\). Let me simplify that using a trigonometric identity. Recall that \\\\(\\\\sin A \\\\sin B = [\\\\cos(A - B) - \\\\cos(A + B)] / 2\\\\). So:\\n\\n\\\\(\\\\sin(2t)\\\\sin(t) = [\\\\cos(2t - t) - \\\\cos(2t + t)] / 2 = [\\\\cos(t) - \\\\cos(3t)] / 2\\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the ODE in terms of \\\\(t\\\\) is:\\n\\n\\\\(y\\'\\' + y = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\cos t - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\cos 3t\\\\).\\n\\nNow, the auxiliary equation for the homogeneous equation \\\\(y\\'\\' + y = 0\\\\) is found by replacing \\\\(y\\'\\'\\\\) with \\\\(m^2\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) with 1, giving \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\). Solving this, the roots are \\\\(m = \\\\pm i\\\\). So, the homogeneous solution is \\\\(y_h = C_1 \\\\cos t + C_2 \\\\sin t\\\\).\\n\\nBut the question asks for the auxiliary equation of the given ODE. Wait, the original ODE is nonhomogeneous, but the auxiliary equation is associated with the homogeneous equation. The auxiliary equation itself is just the characteristic equation obtained from the homogeneous part. So even though the right-hand side has sines and cosines, the auxiliary equation is determined solely by the left-hand side after substitution.\\n\\nSo, after substitution, the left-hand side becomes \\\\(y\\'\\' + y\\\\), so the auxiliary equation is \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\). Therefore, the answer should be \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\).\\n\\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn\\'t skip any steps. The original equation is in terms of \\\\(x\\\\), but after substitution, it\\'s transformed into a constant coefficient equation in terms of \\\\(t\\\\). The auxiliary equation is derived from the homogeneous part of the transformed equation, which is \\\\(y\\'\\' + y = 0\\\\), leading to \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\). Therefore, the auxiliary equation is indeed \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\).\\n\\nBut let me double-check the substitution steps to ensure I didn\\'t make a mistake. Let\\'s rederive \\\\(x^2 D^2 y\\\\) in terms of \\\\(t\\\\). Starting with \\\\(D = d/dx = (1/x) d/dt\\\\), so \\\\(x D = d/dt\\\\). Then \\\\(x^2 D^2 = x D (x D) - x D\\\\). Wait, hold on. Let\\'s compute \\\\(x^2 D^2 y\\\\):\\n\\nFirst, \\\\(x D y = d y / dt\\\\).\\n\\nThen, \\\\(x D (x D y) = x D (dy/dt) = x * d/dx (dy/dt)\\\\).\\n\\nBut \\\\(dy/dt\\\\) is a function of \\\\(t\\\\), so \\\\(d/dx (dy/dt) = d/dt (dy/dt) * dt/dx = (d^2 y/dt^2) * (1/x)\\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, \\\\(x D (x D y) = x * (1/x) d^2 y/dt^2 = d^2 y/dt^2\\\\).\\n\\nBut \\\\(x^2 D^2 y = x D (x D y) - x D y = d^2 y/dt^2 - d y/dt\\\\). \\n\\nWait, so that\\'s the same result as before: \\\\(x^2 D^2 y = y\\'\\' - y\\'\\\\) where \\\\(y\\'\\' = d^2 y/dt^2\\\\) and \\\\(y\\' = dy/dt\\\\). Then, adding \\\\(x D y = dy/dt\\\\) gives:\\n\\n\\\\(x^2 D^2 y + x D y + y = (y\\'\\' - y\\') + y\\' + y = y\\'\\' + y\\\\). So yes, that\\'s correct. Therefore, the transformed equation is \\\\(y\\'\\' + y = \\\\sin(2t)\\\\sin(t)\\\\), which simplifies to \\\\(y\\'\\' + y = [\\\\cos t - \\\\cos 3t]/2\\\\). \\n\\nTherefore, the homogeneous part is \\\\(y\\'\\' + y = 0\\\\), so the auxiliary equation is \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\). Thus, the answer should be \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\), which is the auxiliary equation.\\n\\nBut let me check if the original problem was written correctly. The user specified \"the ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients\". However, the given equation has variable coefficients because of the \\\\(x^2 D^2\\\\) and \\\\(xD\\\\) terms. But after substitution \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\), it becomes a constant coefficient equation. So, the problem is about transforming a variable coefficient ODE into a constant coefficient one via substitution, and then finding the auxiliary equation of the resulting equation.\\n\\nTherefore, the key steps were recognizing the Cauchy-Euler type equation, performing the substitution \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\), converting the differential operators, simplifying the equation, and then writing down the auxiliary equation from the homogeneous part. \\n\\nSo, all steps check out. The auxiliary equation is \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\). Therefore, the final answer is \\\\(\\\\boxed{m^2 + 1 = 0}\\\\).\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe auxiliary equation is \\\\boxed{m^2 + 1 = 0}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo find the auxiliary equation for the given ordinary differential equation \\\\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\\\sin(2\\\\log x)\\\\sin(\\\\log x)\\\\), we start by recognizing that the equation is a Cauchy-Euler type equation. We use the substitution \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\) to transform the equation into one with constant coefficients.\\n\\n1. **Substitution**: Let \\\\(t = \\\\log x\\\\), which implies \\\\(x = e^t\\\\). The differential operators are transformed as follows:\\n   - \\\\(x D = \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\) (where \\\\(D = \\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\))\\n   - \\\\(x^2 D^2 = \\\\frac{d^2}{dt^2} - \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\)\\n\\n2. **Transforming the ODE**: Applying the substitution to the original ODE:\\n   - The left-hand side becomes \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} - \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + y = \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + y\\\\)\\n   - The right-hand side is simplified using trigonometric identities: \\\\(\\\\sin(2t)\\\\sin(t) = \\\\frac{1}{2}[\\\\cos(t) - \\\\cos(3t)]\\\\)\\n\\n3. **Resulting ODE**: The transformed ODE is \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + y = \\\\frac{1}{2}[\\\\cos(t) - \\\\cos(3t)]\\\\).\\n\\n4. **Auxiliary Equation**: The homogeneous part of the transformed ODE is \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + y = 0\\\\), leading to the auxiliary equation \\\\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\\\).\\n\\nThus, the auxiliary equation for the given differential equation is \\\\(\\\\boxed{m^2 + 1 = 0}\\\\).'}"
